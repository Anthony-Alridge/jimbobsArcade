The games app will probably be the only app in this project and on the server side it's primary purpose will be to simply serve the js files. Essentially it is a library. It will also contain the location of a collection of game logic files written in js. 
The other purpose will be to enable users on the site, each with their own highscores etc on the games.
Perhaps this could evolve into something which allows you to write you own js games and easily integrate them into a site?
